Chip-8 emulator to do

Add:
    [ ] Configurable colors and compatibility options using config file
    [x] Debug view (show registers and memory,
                    modifiable memory  and register values)
    [ ] Stepping mode (one instuction per step)
    [x] Switchable fullscreen (with F11) (SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP)
    [x] Implement sound
    [ ] Sound support for windows

Fix:
    [ ] Display correctly if drawn outside of the screen
    [x] Emulation speed should be 500 instructions per sec
    [ ] The delay timer and the sound timer should be independent of the emulation speed
    [ ] Use a POSIX library to implement beep (not ncurses)
